summary: "Demonstrate how Red Hat enables non-data-science users to `instruction-tune` AI models, using some simple RHEL-AI and Instruct Lab tooling"
---

The ACME Financial Services team is on the GenAI hype train and gaining mommentum. They did a lot of experimentation, finetuning, RAG, prompt engineering, but they just found that the hallucinations increased the more finetuning they do, and even the most well engineered prompts would not be a 100% guarantee of the GenAI model not hallucinating.
So the announcement of Instruct LAB is pretty much what they've been looking for.

Your challenge is to 
1) Setup the InstructLab environment
2) Chat with the model (student model) and see what it knows about itself (InstructLab)
3) Add new knowledge 
4) Generate synthetic data (via a teacher model) - this will take approx 15 minutes
5) Verify the synthetic data generation via the critic model output
6) Train the student model to integrate the new knowledge - this will take approx 20 minutes
7) Verify that the new knowledge is present

## 6.0 - Be in the Know...
- You might want to consider that the synthetic data generation will take approx 15min and the model training approx 20min.

Documentation you may find helpful is:

- https://shonpaz.medium.com/rewiring-the-way-we-think-on-ai-part-1-model-fine-tuning-using-instructlab-ebba7017e5d5
- In case you want to build your RHEL AI image yourself later - still dev preview: https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/rhelai-dev-preview

## 6.1 - Setting Up
- Go to demo.redhat.com and order your teams' InstructLab RHEL VM (Nvidia/CUDA) environment
- Use the virtual python environment if you want GPU acceleration
- Install the instruct lab command line tooling
- Download the granite model from instructlab/granite-7b-lab-GGUF and name it 'granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf'
- Serve the Model

## 6.2 - Chat and test knowledge
- Chat with the model and test its knowledge about Instruct Lab 
If you find the answers somewhat peculiar, your mission is to fix that - should you accept it. And no, this message will not self-destruct. Should you be happy with the answer you can select a different knowledge area to improve.

## 6.3 - Add new knowledge
- Utilise the existing InstructLab taxonomy on your image
- Add new knowledge. 
- Optional: Verify that the taxonomy tree is A-OK.

## 6.4 - Generate syntheic data
- Generate new synthetic data with a teacher model 
- Discuss: Does synthetic data generation need a model being served? Why/Why not?

## 6.5 - Verify expected outcomes
- Verify the synthetic data generation via the critic model output
- Discuss: Does the critic model _need_ to be a different model compared to the student or teacher model?
- Create a screenshot showing the files generated via the generate phase and the discarded data from the critic model and post it into the slack channel.

(not so) Fun Fact: The upstream version of ilab doesn't actually use a critic model at the moment, it just checks for format errors. RHEL AI will use a critic model.

## 6.6 - Train the student model
- Does training require a model being served? Why or Why not?
- Decide if you want hardware acceleration, let iLab know, then train the model
- Discuss: When would you / should you use quantisation?

## 6.7 - Chat & verify newly added knowledge
- Chat with the newly trained model and verify if it has the additional knowledge you added.
- Create a screenshot and post it in the slack channel.


## 1.5 - Hints!
The first hint is free: In scenario 6, you will need to provision 15 minutes time for synthetic data generation as well as 20 minutes for model training. You might want to make this part of your strategy to win.

If you get stuck on a question, fear not, perhaps try a different approach. If you have tried everything you can think of and are still stuck you can unlock a hint for `5` points by posting a message in the `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` channel with the message:

> [team name] are stuck on [exercise] and are unlocking a hint.

A hackathon organiser will join your breakout room to share the hint with you 🤫.


TODO Tom - move this to a Google Doc
