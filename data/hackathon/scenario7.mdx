summary: "Can you pull of a clutch live demo for Podman Desktops new AI features?"
---

ACME loved the flexibility at enterprise grade quality and scale of OpenShift AI and also the game changing approach to LLMs through InstructLab. 
But all this excitement needs to be pointed in to the right direction with the right tooling right from when experimentation starts.
"Can you help us?" they want to know - "I am glad you asked" is what you are saying.

In this scenario you showcase the Podman tooling to get started while having Enterprise grade deployments as the destination in mind.
1) Get Podman Desktop running on  your laptop.
2) Install the AI Lab extension
3) Use the AI Lab extension to build your demo app and to access to your code
4) Utilize the Recipe catalogue to deploy the Summarizer recipe
5) Change the application code so that it says 'Hello from Team [Your team name]!'
6) Take a pdf document and let the Summarizer app summarize it.
7) Take a screenshot and show that you changed the Greeting as well as that the summarizer app ran successfully.

- Demonstrate the installation process or upgrade process of Podman Desktop.

## 7.2 - Introducing Podman
Explain what you see when going through podman desktop.
- The team wants to know what version of Podman is required to install the AILab extension.
- Show the ACME team how you can view and access containers, images and volumes
- Browse the current models installed and show how you can download a new model.

## 7.3 - Text Summarizer
Demonstrate the ACME team how you have out of the box recipes you can leverage.
- Use the Summarizer recipe, change the code such that it shows a welcome message with your team name in it.
- Take a screenshot and post into the slack channel.

## 7.4 - Check your work

![Alt text](/hackathon/static/images/hackathon/summarizerHello.png "You want to show something like that plus a summarized document")

If you got your text summarization working on a document of your choice then pls
post a screenshot of the app showing your team name in the welcome message and the summarizer working to `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` with the message:

> Please review [team name] solution for exercise 7.

This exercise is worth `750k`. If you engage the services of the contractor (by obtaining a hint from the hackathon moderators), it will cost you `25k`, which will be deducted from the respective challenge's deal value to your team. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total deal size.
                  

# HINTS
If you get stuck on a question, fear not, perhaps try a different approach. If you have tried everything you can think of and are still stuck you can always hire a contractoor via posting into the  `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` channel with the message:

> [team name] are stuck on [exercise] and are unlocking a hint.

A hackathon organiser will join your breakout room to be at your service  🤫.
