summary: "Can you pull of a clutch live demo for Podman Desktops new AI features?"
---

ACME loved the flexibility at enterprise grade quality and scale of OpenShift AI and also the game changing approach to LLMs through InstructLab. 
But all this excitement needs to be pointed in to the right direction with the right tooling right from when experimentation starts.
"Can you help us?" they want to know - "I am glad you asked" is what you are saying.

In this scenario you showcase the Podman tooling to get started while having Enterprise grade deployments as the destination in mind.
1) Get Podman Desktop running on  your laptop.
2) Install the AI Lab extension
3) Use the AI Lab extension to build your demo app and to access to your code
4) Utilize the Recipe catalogue to deploy the Summarizer recipe
5) Change the application code so that it says 'Hello from Team [Your team name]!'
6) Take a pdf document and let the Summarizer app summarize it.
7) Take a screenshot and show that you changed the Greeting as well as that the summarizer app ran successfully.

# HINTS
If you get stuck on a question, fear not, perhaps try a different approach. If you have tried everything you can think of and are still stuck you can always hire a contractoor via posting into the  `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` channel with the message:

> [team name] are stuck on [exercise] and are unlocking a hint.

A hackathon organiser will join your breakout room to be at your service  ðŸ¤«.

This exercise is worth $750k. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total deal size.
