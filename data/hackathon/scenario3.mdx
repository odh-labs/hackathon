summary: "Let's deploy the first model across the hybrid cloud."
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the ACME Financial Services data science team, who have been training models on their laptops.
The team have given you access to one of their models in the ACME Financial Services object storage and want to see how this could be deployed to a cluster running in the cloud.

## 3.1 - Examine your On-Premises and Cloud based storage

For this task, your team are required to use the `granite-7b-lab` model available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio.

The `granite-7b-lab` model is available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio. It's located under the `models` bucket.
After locating the model in on premises object storage, your team will need to replicate this model to the ACME Financial Services cloud cluster object storage (to a bucket and sub-folder under the same name) so that it could be served in future.

Examine both storage locations.

## 3.2 - Install  operators related to Openshift AI 

Now that you're aware of ACME's replication requirements their chosen model to their cloud OpenShift Cluster, it's time to do that replication and then serve the model ASAP.

For the first part of this challenge your team must demonstrate to ACME how to install OpenShift AI, replicate to the cloud and serve the existing model called `granite-7b-lab` via OpenShift AI.

Install the following opertors (do not install any custom resources)
- OpenShift AI
- OpenShift Service Mesh
- OpenShift Serverless


## 3.3 - Install OpenShift AI
Wait until the three operators specified in the previoius section have fully provisioned, before proceeding.
You won't need any Custom Resources for OpenShift Service Mesh and OpenShift Serverless

You will need one for OpenShift AI. A valid strategy would be to open the yaml view and go with all the defaults - the only addition to be to add this knative-serving-cert secret
        ingressGateway:
          certificate:
            secretName: knative-serving-cert

## 3.4 - Set up your OpenShift AI project and workbench

An OpenShift AI project maps directly to an OpenShift project, enjoying the same RBAC and isoltion capailities.
OpenShift AI Workbenches pertain to a base container image, encapsulating a particular toolset used by the data scientists, e.g. Pytorch, Tensorflow etc.

Now open OpenShift AI and do the following
- create a project
- create a workbench that 
  - uses Pytorch as a basis
  - uses a Persistent Volume of at least 60GB 
  - uses a Data Connection to your Minio object storage
  - uses a Medium sized Container without an accelerator

## 3.5 - Replicate Model to Cloud Storage

For this task, your team are required to use the `granite-7b-lab` model available in the object storage running in the ACME Financial Services on prem cluster which is based on Minio.

How you do this replication is up to you. There are options using the Minio CLI and also using hint 3.5 below.

## 3.6 - Use your cloud-based OpenShift AI to Serve the model and make it easily consumable by intelligent applications for inference
Single Model Serving is the preferred mode for serving LLMs

### 3.6.1 - Import a VLLM Server and enable Single Model Serving
VLLM is a popular model server format whose APIs are compatible with Open AI (Chat GPT) APIs. This format then lends itself to easy migration of apps already using Open AI - to OpenShift AI.

You may use Hint 3.6.1 below

Documentation you may find helpful is:

### 3.6.2 - Create a Single Model Server on your cloud based OpenShift

Documentation you may find helpful is:
- https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.9/html-single/serving_models/index#deploying-models-on-the-single-model-serving-platform_serving-large-models

### 3.4.3 - Make an Inference call to the model.

Note you should not need to use a token.

You may use Hint 3.6.2 below


Documentation you may find helpful is:

## 1.5 - Hints!
The first hint is free: In scenario 6, you will need to provision 15 minutes time for synthetic data generation as well as 20 minutes for model training. You might want to make this part of your strategy to win.

If you get stuck on a question, fear not, perhaps try a different approach. If you have tried everything you can think of and are still stuck you can unlock a hint for `5` points by posting a message in the `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` channel with the message:

> [team name] are stuck on [exercise] and are unlocking a hint.

A hackathon organiser will join your breakout room to share the hint with you 🤫.


TODO Tom - move this to Google Docs

HINTS
[3.5] You can use this notebook to pull from local object storage and push to cloud object storage
    https://github.com/tnscorcoran/rhods-finetunning-demo/blob/main/minio_pull_from_and_push_to.ipynb
    TODO - Code the notebook and move it to the correct git repo
    (note in a production environment, this would likely be automed using Gitops)
    TODO - confirm Gitops would be used

[3.6.1] You can import this yaml to set up your vLLM server

  TODO correct location
