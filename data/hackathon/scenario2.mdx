summary: "How do we use GPU accelerators??"
---

As a sales team you've got an upcoming demo with the ACME Financial Services data science team, who have asked you to show them how to enable GPU support on their Cloud cluster (in your case represented by Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA))?

You've spun up a demo environment to show them how it's done.

## 2.1 - View Cluster GPU Machine Set

For convenience, we have pre-ordered a new Machine Set using one of the g5 GPU instance types.

Navigate to Compute > Machinesets and notice a Machineset using tone of the g5 GPU instance types.
This is your GPU node.

## 2.2 - Install required operators

While the GPU machine is provisioning, the next step is to install the two required operators:
- Node Feature Discovery (NFD)
- Nvidia GPU Operator

Install the following Custom resources - go with defaults
- NodeFeatureDiscovery
- ClusterPolicy

## 2.3 - Check your work

There is a CLI called `nvidia-smi` that you need to run within one of the pods to output various data associated the particular GPU model this node uses.

Your challenge is to take a screenshot showing the Nvidia GPU and share that screenshot.

Once done, please post a message in `#event-anz-ocp-ai-hackathon` with the screenshot and message:

> Please review [team name] solution for exercise 2.

This exercise is worth `750k`. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total deal size.
