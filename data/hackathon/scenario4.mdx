summary: "Let's add some tooling available in a standardised way to all data science users"

The ACME Financial Services team are underway with the OpenShift AI Proof of Concept and are now stuck with a workbench problem.
The ACME has been using the `Standard Data Science` workbench image with `Python 3.9` and are now trying to enable additional libraries for their entire team.
While experimenting they were completing this with a `pip install` inside their Jupyter Notebooks. They now need these libraries to be baked into their workbench images, so they can standardise on tooling across the team.

As the pre-sales team, you've offered to show how this is done.

## 4.1 - Review notebook requiring custom Python library within an existing workbench

Fire up an OpenShift AI workbench, using the `Standard Data Science` base image and launch/run the Notebook https://github.com/odh-labs/hackathon/blob/main/temp/scenario4_open_innovation/custom-image.ipynb
You see it fails due to missing library `pypdf`.

## 4.2 - Build custom workbench image

Your first task after reviewing the failing scenario to build a custom workbench image on the ACME Financial Services cluster.  

You have 2 options 
1) Use a Build Config and push the image as an Image Stream into the  `redhat-ods-applications` namespace
2) Use Podman to build a container locally and push to Internal OpenShift Container Registry, then add it to OpenShift AI through the web interface.

Your custom image name should be `acme-workbench-ai-custom`

- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/cicd/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html
- https://github.com/opendatahub-io-contrib/workbench-images

## 4.3 - Ensure Image is present in the Internal OpenShift Container Registry

After building an image, you'll need to ensure the image is present in the Internal OpenShift Container Registry.

Documentation you may find helpful is:
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/registry/index.html
- https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.15/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html

TODO Add screenshots

## 4.4 - Verify image is imported into OpenShift AI
Your newly imported image should be visible in the `Image selection` dropdown within the Workbench tab inside your OpenShift AI 

TODO Add screenshots

## 4.5 - Check your work
If your ACME Financial Services custom image  `acme-workbench-ai-custom` is available in the dropdown, please post a screenshot of it to  #event-anz-ai-hackathon with the message:

Please review [team name] solution for exercise 4.

This exercise is worth 25 points. The event team will reply in slack to confirm your updated team total score.
